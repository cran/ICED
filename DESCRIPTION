Description: Estimate test-retest reliability for complex sampling strategies 
    and extract variances using IntraClass Effect Decomposition. Developed by
    Brandmaier et al. (2018) "Assessing reliability in neuroimaging research through intra-class effect decomposition (ICED)" <doi:10.7554/eLife.35718> 
    Also includes functions to simulate data based on sampling strategy. 
    Unofficial version release name: "Good work squirrels".
